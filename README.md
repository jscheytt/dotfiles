## What is this repo for?

I strive for reproducibility a lot, so I also want the process of setting up a new machine be as automatic and idempotent as possible.

This repo can do the following for me (and also for you ðŸ˜Š):

* Install all dependencies mentioned in `Brewfile` (Homebrew), and `Pipfile` (Python)
* Set up (ohmy)zsh and dotfiles
* Set some sane global git configuration
* Set up NeoVim with some plugins

## Recommended Usage

* You can always run `make` to see all available commands.
* Initial usage: `make install build`
* Update pipenv dependencies: `make update`
* Run only the installation: `make install`
* Run the main playbook: `make build`
* Start from a clean slate: `make clean build`

## References and Kudos

* Thanks to Adam Johnson for his [mac-ansible role](https://github.com/adamchainz/mac-ansible).
